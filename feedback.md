#### Dr. Kuchera's Notes:

**Data exploration:** None? Did you normalize the data? Did you use all of it? Train/validation/test split?

**Model choice/exploration** Why kNN?

**Code:** Code is well documented, but I am confused as to whether I should be using `MNIST.ipynb` or `sklearn_algor.py`. The notebook doesn't seem to use the module.

**Objective description** Good.

**Organization**  Good


**Analysis**  If k=3 performed the best, why did you not try k=2,1? 


**Results** Results presented in a concise way with appropriate metrics. Are your results on test data? How much data was used for testing?


**Writing**  Writing is very clear (thank you).
